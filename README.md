The first function worked fine for me, and all the tests passed for that function. For the second and third function, it didn't tell me if it passed or failed, so I think there is some code wrong in there. For the final 3 functions they all failed each test so I think that I have something wrong there as well. I also changed my main file to actually be able to read and parse the file properly.
